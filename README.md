## Capstone project
### ResNet-50 for Cats.Vs.Dogs.

### Necessary Libraries
- keras
- NumPy
- cv2
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- tqdm

### Dataset
Initial dataset is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data). The dataset includes two folders *test* and *train*.

But I split *train* folder manual into 2 folders:

- trian ---- including two folders
	- cat ---- including 12000 cat images
	- dog ---- including 12000 dog images
- valid ---- including two folders 
 	- cat ---- including 500 cat images
	- dog ---- including 500 dog images


The changed dataset can download from the [link]() I shared from pCloud.
